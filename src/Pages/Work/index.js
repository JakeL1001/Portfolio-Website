This Project is focused around the concept of Mean Reversion, a mathematical theory which claims that seeing a result that is significantly above or below a mean, will mean that the next result is likely to be closer to the mean. Therefore, in theory, you can place buy or sell orders for financial assets on the basis of how far the current price is from the average price. The project will task the Trading Team with creating an optimized trading algorithm which utilizes Mean Reversion to turn a profit on historical price data."
