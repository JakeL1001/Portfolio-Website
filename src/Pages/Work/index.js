<p className='Job-Project-desc'>In the process of creating a rapid back testing framework to test the performance of quantitative trading algorithms for use by the 2022 QFin Trading Team. It will allow users to test their quantitative algorithms on historical price data for stocks and cryptocurrencies. It will also be optimized to allow for multicore processing and parameter sweeping for algorithm optimization. We hope to have this framework be published on PyPI for easy installation through pip for use in educational workshops run by QFin.</p>

This Project is focused around the concept of Mean Reversion, a mathematical theory which claims that seeing a result that is significantly above or below a mean, will mean that the next result is likely to be closer to the mean. Therefore, in theory, you can place buy or sell orders for financial assets on the basis of how far the current price is from the average price. The project will task the Trading Team with creating an optimized trading algorithm which utilizes Mean Reversion to turn a profit on historical price data.</p>
